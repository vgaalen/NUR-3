\newpage
\subsection*{a}
Here the goal is to find the x-value for which the number density of satellite galaxies is the highest (using the same formula as in hand-in 2).
I chose to use a golden ratio search algorithm here, as it can find a minimum (or maximum) within a bracket without any option to jump out.
As the exercise gave a specific range to search in, this algorithm is well suited here.

This gave the following solution:

\subsection*{b}
For this exercise a dataset containing the positions of millions of satellite galaxies relative to their cluster center is used to fit a number density profile.
The profile from the second hand-in is used again, but now the a, b, and c parameters are fitted to the data.
This is done for 5 different bins for halo mass.

In order to compare the discrete galaxy positions with number densities, these galaxies are binned based on their distance to the cluster center.
I decided to use 20 bins scaled logarithmically between x=0.1 and x=2.5. 
Figure \ref{fig:ex1b_0} shows that the satellite galaxy distribution falls off very quickly towards x=2.5. 
Taking a larger $x_{max}$ would therefore only add empty bins increasing computation time.
The lower bound was taken such that about half of the bins would fall into the model's power-law regime and half in the exponential regime.
The number of bins was chosen as to accurately describe the drop-off with as little bins as possible.
As a lower number of bins gives us more galaxies in each bin, the error margin on these values should decrease.
20 bins gave a good tradeoff between these arguments.

A downhill simplex minimization algorithm is then used to find the best fit for the parameters based on a $\chi^2$.
The are no errors on the dataset, therefore $\sigma^2 = N$ was used here.

For the Downhill Simplex's initial points I took a random sample (using the RNG from hand in 2) of points within a reasonable range.
This range was determined by eye using figure \ref{fig:Ndx} balancing a good view of the parameter space and giving a good initial guess for our dataset.
This gave $1\leq a_{init}\leq 10$, $0.15\leq b_{init}\leq 0.75$, and $1\leq c_{init}\leq 5$.

\subsection*{c}
This exercise is very similar to 1b, except that the assumption of a Gaussian distribution around the density profile is dropped.
As it is a distribution around a number density, a Poisson distribution is more accurate.

The best fit values found are:

These give the profiles that can be seen in figures \ref{fig:ex1c_0}-\ref{fig:ex1c_4}.

\subsection*{d}
For this exercise the results of 1b and 1c are compared.
A G-test is used for this.

By calculating the significance Q of G these approaches can be compared.
For the degrees of freedom I used $k=3$, this because we are fitting for 3 parameters (as we compare the model to data at discrete set of x-values, this is not a degree of freedom).

This gave the following values:
\lstinputlisting{output/ex1d.txt}

The values found when minimizing the Poisson log likelihood the highest (and therefore best) Q-values are found.
This is to be expected as the observed data is number of satellite galaxies in at a certain radius.
The actual observations (before taking the mean over a sample of halos) can only take positive integer values, the probability on which is better described by a Poissonian than a Gaussian.
It is notable though, that for halo masses of $\sim 10^{11}$ Msun the Q-values are very low despite figures \ref{fig:ex1b_0} and \ref{fig:ex1c_0} showing a reasonable fit.
